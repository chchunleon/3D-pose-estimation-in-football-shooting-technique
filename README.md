## For Frontend, you can run:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## To start the server:

### `python app.py`

It will start the flask application and listens the the request from the frontend side.
